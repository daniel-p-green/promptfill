1. Logo is present, clear, and placed consistently.
2. CTA appears once and is readable within safe zones.
3. Contrast between text and background is legible.
4. Typography uses tokenized sizes and families.
5. Motion uses named presets only (`subtle|medium|punchy`).
6. Card/grid spacing follows token scale.
7. No one-off drop shadows or blur values.
8. Scene is understandable with and without audio.
9. Hook is <= 8 words and occupies <= 2 lines.
10. Problem scene uses <= 3 bullets, each 2-4 words.
11. One scene has one primary job only: Hook / Problem / Solution / CTA.
12. No stacked claims like \"best + fastest + cheapest\" in the same line.
