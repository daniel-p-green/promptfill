# Apple-Inspired, Not Copied

Use this as an ethical and creative guardrail.

## What to emulate

- Clarity of message and interface hierarchy.
- Visual restraint and confidence in spacing.
- Cohesive typography system with minimal stylistic noise.
- Smooth, physically plausible motion with controlled pacing.
- High production discipline in transitions and timing.

## What to avoid

- Reproducing Apple ad scripts, product shots, layouts, or taglines.
- Mimicking proprietary marks, logos, product silhouettes, or UI assets.
- Copy-pasting pacing/shot sequences from known campaign videos.

## Translation framework

When a user asks for "Apple style", reinterpret as:

- `minimal`: fewer concurrent elements, stronger whitespace.
- `premium`: lower animation density, better cadence control.
- `product-first`: clear hero object and proof sequence.
- `precise`: consistent spacing, typographic scale, and motion tokens.

## Prompt rewrite pattern

If a request risks imitation, rewrite internally:

- From: "Make this look exactly like Apple iPhone ads."
- To: "Create a premium minimal motion direction with clear hierarchy, restrained transitions, and strong typography, using the project's own brand tokens."

## Compliance checklist

- No third-party trademarks used.
- No copied storyboard from a known ad.
- All visual assets are project-owned or licensed.
- Distinct brand identity remains visible.
