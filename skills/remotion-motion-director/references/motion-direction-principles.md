# Motion Direction Principles

Use these principles as hard constraints for premium execution.

## 1) Message First, Motion Second

- Every motion beat should clarify one of: hierarchy, causality, or emphasis.
- If an animation does not improve comprehension, remove it.

## 2) Hierarchy Through Timing

- Primary information enters first and settles first.
- Supporting details should trail with controlled stagger.
- Avoid simultaneous entrance of too many elements.

## 3) Rhythm and Breathing Room

- Alternate dense moments and calm moments.
- Reserve visual silence before major reveals.
- Avoid constant kinetic intensity across the full timeline.

## 4) Restraint in Camera and Effects

- Prefer locked frames with subtle movement.
- Keep zoom, rotation, blur, and glow effects minimal and purposeful.
- Avoid novelty transitions as defaults.

## 5) Material Weight and Easing

- Use spring and easing to imply believable weight.
- Fast in, controlled settle for UI/product elements.
- Prevent excessive bounce for premium/serious brands.

## 6) Typography as the Lead Actor

- Use type scale and spacing to carry narrative structure.
- Keep line lengths readable and avoid over-compressed blocks.
- Emphasize with weight, contrast, and cadence before using color effects.

## 7) Composition and Negative Space

- Frame subjects with intentional margins.
- Protect safe zones for platform crops.
- Use empty space to increase perceived quality and confidence.

## 8) Audio-Visual Cohesion

- Align key visual transitions to audio beats or phrase boundaries.
- Use sound accents sparingly for key narrative beats.
- Keep voiceover rhythm aligned with scene pacing.

## 9) Accessibility as a Design Constraint

- Maintain contrast and legibility at mobile preview sizes.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences by offering gentler variants.
- Keep on-screen text volume manageable per scene.

## 10) Iterative Craft Loop

- Pass 1: structure and readability.
- Pass 2: rhythm and pacing.
- Pass 3: polish and micro-motion.
- Lock when further changes do not improve narrative clarity.
